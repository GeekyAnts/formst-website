This page provides some additional resources to get the most out of React Native ARIA and make accessible web/mobile apps.

- **Semantic Markup on React Native Web:**

It's possible to write semantic HTML using only React Native Web [as mentioned here.](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/accessibility/#semantic-html)

However, you should definitely checkout [this awesome package](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/html-elements) from the expo team which makes it much easier.
