import { Install } from "../src/components/Install";

Determines whether a focus ring should be shown to indicate keyboard focus. Focus rings are visible only when the user is interacting with a keyboard, not with a mouse, touch, or other input methods.

:::note
React Native Web by default adds a focus ring but currently doesn't provide a way to customize it's appearance.
