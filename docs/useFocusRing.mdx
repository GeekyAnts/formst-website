import { Install } from "../src/components/Install";

Determines whether a focus ring should be shown to indicate keyboard focus. Focus rings are visible only when the user is interacting with a keyboard, not with a mouse, touch, or other input methods.

:::note
React Native Web adds a default blue focus ring on focusable elements.
Use this hook if you want to customize it's styling for accessibility or other reasons.
