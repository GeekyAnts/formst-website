import { Install } from "../src/components/Install";

React Native Aria is incrementally adoptable. Each component is published as a separate package, so you can try it out in a single component and gradually add more over time. All of these packages are published under the [@react-native-aria](https://www.npmjs.com/org/react-native-aria) scope on npm.

**Installing individual package**

<Install p={"@react-native-aria/checkbox"} />

Usage

```jsx
import { useCheckbox } from "@react-native-aria/checkbox";
```

In addition to individual packages, we also offer a mono-package containing all of the React Native Aria hooks in a single package.

**Installing mono package**

<Install p={"react-native-aria"} />

Usage

```jsx
import { useCheckbox } from "react-native-aria";
```

:::info
In each package we have platform specific entry points. For e.g. index.web.ts and index.ts. This ensures that code for web doesn't get shipped on iOS/Android bundles and vice versa.
